SharePoint Messenger
===================

I won't be updating this project any longer, it is legacy. 

Description
-
I started this project to give SharePoint the chat/message functionality and to expand my SharePoint knowledge. I know that there are features out there that allow chat functionality however, I wanted to take it a bit further and allow users to specify the recipients, allow administration of the list items and groups and to give a richer experience to the end user.

Installation
-
I want the installation to be as simple as possible. Currently there is a site and web feature. This is a farm solution. The site feature deploys the content type and fields. The web feature creates the permissions, the group and the list.

1. Deploy the solution to the farm
2. Activate the site feature
3. Activate the web feature
4. Add any users that you would like to have permission to the Sharepoint Messenger Group
5. Add webparts to the pages that you would like the chat to show up
